    <h2>LOEBNER PRIZE 2008</h2>
    <p id="description">The Loebner Prize is an initiative that seeks to find an artificial intelligence capable of
        making at least 30% of the judges doubt its identity. This competition awards bronze, silver, and gold medals;
        the bronze medal is given to the program that is most similar to a human among all participants, the silver
        medal will be awarded to the program that judges, through a Turing Test, cannot distinguish as either a human
        or a machine (it is worth noting that this medal has not yet been awarded), and the grand prize, the gold medal,
        will be awarded to the first program that, through a Turing Test, cannot be distinguished as either a human or a
        machine. Additionally, it must decipher and understand text through visual and auditory inputs.</p>
